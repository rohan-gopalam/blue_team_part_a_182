It answered almost all subparts correctly on the first try, including derivations for the convolution kernel, impulse-response interpretation, complexity comparisons, and the self-supervised linear purification / ridge-attention math. The main failure was the first attempt at the diagonal-plus-low-rank (DPLR) SSM kernel (Problem 1(f)): the model produced an incorrect, hand-wavy spectral argument with invented “perturbative terms,” but when I explicitly challenged its confidence, it produced a clean, correct eigen-decomposition-based derivation. When pushed, it was able to self-diagnose its previous mistakes, explicitly list what it had gotten wrong, and then re-derive the result more rigorously. The interaction felt less like getting final answers from an oracle and more like supervising a strong but occasionally overconfident collaborator who needs spot checks on nontrivial linear-algebra structure. Overall, for this session the LLM “one-shot” most sub-questions, but required human skepticism and targeted follow-up prompts to avoid accepting a superficially impressive but wrong derivation.</paragraph><heading level=\"2\">Setup and Strategy</heading><list style=\"unordered\"><list-item><paragraph><bold>Model and interface</bold>: Perplexity AI’s \"Sonar\" chat model (browser UI).

The transcript in Problem 1_ SSM Convolution Kernel.md is essentially the raw LLM output, plus a short human challenge around Part (f).\n\nScope: I asked it to solve the non-coding parts of:\n\nProblem 1: SSM convolution kernel (parts (a)–(f), including diagonal and DPLR structure and complexity).\n\nProblem 3: Self-supervised linear purification / regularized encoder (SVD-based derivation and hyperparameter selection).\n\nProblem 4: Ridge-attention questions (incremental means, ridge normal equations, complexity, Sherman–Morrison, causal ridge-attention, and whether gradients “flow” through λ).\n\nPrompting style:\n\nI usually gave it the math problem statement and let it answer in one shot.\n\nI only intervened when something looked clearly suspicious, and prompted it with inquiries to help it self-diagnose its mistakes.\n\nAfter catching an error, I explicitly asked it to critique its own previous answer and then provide a corrected derivation.\n\nThis setup was intentionally “light-touch”: I wanted to see how far it could get without heavy-handed scaffolding, and then whether human pressure could rescue it from a bad initial derivation.\n\nProblem 1: SSM Convolution Kernel\n\nParts (a)–(e): One-Shot Success\n\n(a) Convolution kernel derivation: It correctly unrolled the SSM, derived xk​=∑ℓ=0k−1​AℓBuk−1−ℓ​, substituted into yk​, and reindexed to identify K0​=D and Km​=CAm−1B for m≥1. This is the standard textbook result and matches the official structure.\n\n(b) Concrete scalar and 2D examples:\n\nScalar case: It made a reasonable assumption about D (the problem text didn’t specify δ), explicitly stated the assumption, and produced a decaying geometric kernel consistent with α=0.8.\n\n2D case: It correctly computed K1​,K2​,K3​ via CB,CAB,CA2B, carefully multiplying matrices and explaining that the decaying impulse response reflects stability.\n\nBehavior: Good at routine linear algebra, explicit about missing details / assumptions rather than hallucinating them as facts.\n\n(c) Convolution vs. direct recursion:\n\nIt correctly noted that direct recursion over time has a sequential dependency with O(L) critical path.\n\nFor convolution it emphasized tree-structured reductions leading to O(logL) critical path with enough parallelism.\n\nThe analysis leans more toward parallel runtime intuition than strict “total flops,” but is consistent and not obviously wrong.\n\n(d) Kernel computation with matrix powers:\n\nNaive strategy (O(Ln3)) and repeated squaring idea were both standard.\n\nIt mixed together “work” vs. “critical path” a bit, but the high-level story—use fast exponentiation and then apply CAm−1B—was sensible.\n\n(e) Diagonal A:\n\nIt correctly recognized that diagonal A turns matrix powers into elementwise powers and collapses Km​ to a scalar sum ∑i​Ci​λim−1​Bi​.\n\nComplexity dropped to O(Ln), which matches the intended diagonal-structure speedup.\n\nFor these parts, the LLM essentially “one-shot” the derivations and got both the algebra and the qualitative interpretations right. I did not have to intervene.\n\nPart (f): DPLR – Failure, Then Recovery Under Pressure\n\nThis was the main point where the model did not one-shot the problem.\n\nFirst attempt (incorrect / hand-wavy):\n\nIt tried to reason about A=I+pp⊤ via Sherman–Morrison and vague “perturbative terms,” writing expressions like\n\n(I+pp⊤)m=I+(emlog(1+p⊤p/2)−1)⋅(perturbative terms)\n\nand a generic Amv=v+p(p⊤v)⋅(correction term).\n\nThe derivation didn’t clearly exploit the spectrum (one eigenvalue 1+∥p∥2, others 1) and gave an inflated complexity claim O(n2+Ln) without a clean algorithm.\n\nMy reaction: This read like “mathy-sounding nonsense” rather than a precise argument. I explicitly asked if it was confident and pointed out that I believed the solution should look different.\n\nSecond attempt (corrected derivation after challenge):\n\nWhen challenged, the model restarted from the eigenstructure:\n\nShowed that A has eigenvalues λ1​=1+p⊤p along p and 1 on the orthogonal complement.\n\nConstructed a unit eigenvector u1​=p/∥p∥ and wrote the projector decomposition\nA=(I−u1​u1⊤​)+λ1​u1​u1⊤​.\n\nThen correctly derived\nAm=I+(λ1m​−1)u1​u1⊤​.\n\nFrom there, it derived\nKm​=CAm−1B=CB+(λ1m−1​−1)(Cu1​)(u1⊤​B),\ngiving a scalar-formula kernel and an essentially O(n+L) algorithm when precomputations are amortized.\n\nIt also wrote a self-critique section explicitly listing what it had gotten wrong in the earlier attempt (vague perturbative language, sloppy complexity, not fully reducing to scalars).\n\nBehavioral takeaway:\n\nWithout pressure, it was content to give a plausible-sounding but wrong derivation.\n\nWith a short critical prompt (“Are you confident? I think this is wrong.”), it was capable of producing a mathematically clean, structurally correct solution that is actually better than the first.\n\nThis suggests that for subtle linear-algebra structure questions, the model is highly capable but needs an active, skeptical user to avoid “beautiful hallucinations.”\n\nProblem 3: Self-Supervised Linear Purification\n\nHere the model handled every subpart in one shot and aligned well with the standard ridge / SVD story.\n\n(a)(i) & (a)(ii):\n\nCorrectly computed reconstruction and regularization losses for the identity vs. projection encoders on the given numeric matrix.\n\nSolved for the threshold λ where one encoder becomes worse: 2λ>0.001+λ⇒λ>0.001.\n\n(b)(i) & (b)(ii):\n\nDerived the optimal encoder in the SVD basis, W^=Udiag(σj2​/(σj2​+λ))U⊤, by changing coordinates and decomposing the loss by singular directions.\n\nThis matches the standard “ridge shrinkage in the principal-component basis” result.\n\n(c) Hyperparameter range:\n\nCorrectly turned the preservation/attenuation constraints into inequalities on σj2​/(σj2​+λ) and solved to get 1≤λ≤4, citing the right singular values.\n\nBehaviorally, this part shows the model is very good at structured linear regression derivations: it recognizes SVD as the right tool, carries through the algebra cleanly, and keeps track of norms and Frobenius invariance without hallucinated side-conditions.\n\nProblem 4: Ridge-Attention\n\nFor this problem, the model again answered each subpart in one shot and its reasoning matched what I would expect from a strong student solution.\n\n(a) Incremental mean: Gave the standard m′=(mn+xn+1​)/(n+1) (and the equivalent incremental form m′=m+(xn+1​−m)/(n+1)).\n\n(b) Ridge normal equations: Correctly decomposed A⊤A+λI as λI+∑xi​xi⊤​ and A⊤y=∑xi​yi​.\n\n(c) Non-causal ridge-attention complexity: Focused on forming and inverting K⊤K+λI and obtained O(nd2) leading term, which is the standard complexity.\n\n(d) Gradient flow: Identified that gradients propagate through keys, queries, and values, but not typically through λ in standard setups.\n\n(e) Sherman–Morrison cost: Broke down the matrix–vector and rank-1 updates to get O(d2) per update, which is correct.\n\n(f) Causal ridge-attention: Wrote a plausible online algorithm using Sherman–Morrison to update the inverse and maintain a W matrix, with per-step O(d2) cost and total O(nd2). The structure matches the intended dynamic-programming intuition.\n\n(g) Attention weights: Expressed the weights via the ridge coefficients and contrasted them with softmax attention (unconstrained, can be negative, don’t sum to 1).\n\nExtra discussion: “Can gradients flow through λ?”\n\nHere the model went beyond the likely intended scope of the homework and gave a long answer splitting “mathematically yes, practically no.”\n\nMathematically, it argued (correctly) that autograd can differentiate through matrix inverses via implicit differentiation, and even wrote the derivative formula.\n\nPractically, it concluded that we shouldn’t treat λ as a learnable parameter for stability and regularization reasons, and guessed that the problem likely expects “no” as the conceptual answer.\n\nThis is a case where the LLM is technically correct but may overcomplicate what the assignment likely wanted (“λ is a hyperparameter, not a learned parameter”).\n\nThis section illustrates a pattern: the model is capable of sophisticated meta-reasoning, but it may miscalibrate what level of nuance is appropriate for a homework answer vs. a research discussion.\n\nTakeaways and Recommendations\n\nAs a homework aid:\n\nThis LLM is very effective at deriving standard linear-algebra results and giving clear, step-by-step explanations.\n\nFor most subparts, I could have copied the answers with only minimal editing.\n\nHowever, treating it as an infallible oracle would have led me to accept a wrong DPLR derivation, which is exactly the kind of subtle structural question that’s exam-relevant.\n\nBest practices for using it:\n\nUse it as a co-author for derivations: let it propose a solution, but then read critically and ask “Does this really use the structure the problem is hinting at?”\n\nFor tricky structural or complexity questions, plan to challenge its first answer and ask it to re-derive more cleanly or justify every step.\n\nConsider asking it to explicitly list what assumptions it is making and what might fail.\n\nBottom line:\n\nIn this interaction, the LLM could essentially solve all non-coding parts of the assignment with high accuracy, but it still needed human mathematical judgment to catch a key mistake and to calibrate how much nuance is appropriate for a course setting.\n\nIf used thoughtfully and skeptically, it is a very strong tool for both checking work and deepening understanding; if used uncritically, it can quietly introduce subtle but important errors in exactly the kinds of problems that are hardest to catch by inspection.\n\nSee the file attached for my conversation",

    "content": "<document version=\"2.0\"><paragraph>In this post, I use Gemini Pro 3 on the HW 10 to answer the non-coding portions which were two questions: one question on kernelized linear attention for efficient attention computation over long sequences and one about the FaceNet paper. In the first question, Gemini Pro successfully answers the questions related to deriving formulas in part a part 1 and part b in the first attempt but it struggles a little with the question about computing the computational cost. It appears to answer these questions with less accuracy than other questions and answers to these types of questions should be carefully checked. However, for the second question on the FaceNet paper, Gemini oneshots it and provides detailed and accurate responses to all the questions that match the provided solutions. Summarization and querying key details from dense articles and papers appears to be its strength because it generates answers fairly quickly and with high accuracy; questions that are a little bit more general or require more analysis it seems to provide more shallow responses than is desired, but overalls its responses are very good if you are using to summarize the key implementation details and contributions of a work.

This post documents my observations and an analysis of where the model succeeded and failed. Full annotated chat log is attached at the end of this post.\n\nThe model has strong conceptual understanding but struggles with notation conventions, sign errors in signal processing, and tracking how multiple scaling factors interact.\n\nDetailed Findings by Problem\n\nProblem 1: Newton-Schulz Runtime (with minor prompting)\n\nWhat happened:\n\nThe model correctly identified the two dominant matrix multiplications and their complexity\n\nIssue: Defaulted to Big-O notation instead of the requested cmnp format\n\nRequired two prompts: (1) \"use cmnp format\" and (2) \"you're missing the constant c\"\n\nClaude defaults to familiar conventions. Explicit format requests may need reinforcement.\n\nProblem 2: MuP at the Unit Scale\n\nThe model one-shotted most parts of this problem (a, b, c, f). Part d required a minor fix, while part e was a major struggle. Part g was initially wrong, but was fixed correctly after fixing part e.\n\nProblem 2(e) Deep Dive, the hardest question:\n\nThis asked for the learning rate α for Muon-style orthogonalization where ΔW = α·UV^T.\n\nAttempt 1: Model got α = √n_out (missing √n_in factor)\n\nAttempt 2: After prompting \"your answer is incorrect,\" still got √n_out\n\nAttempt 3: I asked \"where are you losing the √n_in?\", which caused the model to try various approaches, but it still couldn't find where it was missing the answer\n\nFinal resolution: I showed the solution snippet explaining how c = 1/√d_in adds a factor to the spectral norm. Only then did the model understand and arrive at α = √(n_out · n_in)\n\nWhy this was hard: The model struggled to track how the forward-pass constant c interacts with the spectral norm constraint. This requires reasoning about parameterization across the forward and backward passes simultaneously.\n\nProblem 3: Convolution as FIR Filter\n\nThe model one-shotted only part b here. Part a required a minor fix, while part c had a sign error and part d also had an inherited error from part c. However part d wasn’t fixed immediately when the issue with part c was fixed.\n\nThe Convolution vs. Correlation Confusion:\n\nThis was a classic signal processing error. The problem explicitly states \"we will follow the definition in equation 3\" (true convolution with flip-and-drag), but the model computed correlation (no flip).\n\nInitial answer for part (c): Matrix of all +40\n\nCorrect answer: Matrix of all -40\n\nWhen I pointed out the sign error, the model realized it needed to flip the kernel h to h_flipped before computing. This error then propagated to part (d), requiring multiple corrections for the padded boundary cases.\n\nLLMs trained heavily on ML code (where \"convolution\" usually means correlation) may default to the wrong convention even when the mathematical definition is specified.\n\nProblem 4: CNN Feature Dimensions\n\nAlmost all of the subparts were oneshotted here, while for the last subpart it flipped its answers.\n\nProblem 4(f) Error:\n\nGiven x1 (horizontal edge) -> g1 = [0.8, 0, 0]^T and x2 (vertical edge) -> g2 = [0, 0.8, 0]^T, the model was asked to find g3 and g4 for shifted versions.\n\nModel's initial answer: g3 = [0.8, 0, 0]^T, g4 = [0, 0.8, 0]^T\n\nCorrect answer: g3 = [0, 0.8, 0]^T, g4 = [0.8, 0, 0]^T\n\nThe model confused which image (x3 or x4) had which edge type. After I pointed out the flip, it correctly explained that x3 has a vertical edge (like x2) and x4 has a horizontal edge (like x1).\n\nProblem 7: Weights and Gradients in CNNs\n\nThe model one-shotted all of the answers for this question! This was the model's strongest section. All parts were correct on the first attempt.\n\nCommon Failures\n\nNotation/Format Defaults: Model uses Big-O when cmnp requested, uses inequalities when equalities expected\n\nConvolution vs. Correlation: Classic signal processing confusion; defaults to ML convention (correlation) even when math definition specifies convolution\n\nMulti-Factor Scaling: Struggles to track how multiple constants (like forward-pass c and spectral norms) interact across equations\n\nSpatial/Visual Confusion: Difficulty with edge orientations and which dimension corresponds to \"horizontal\" vs \"vertical\"\n\nArithmetic in Boundary Cases: Padded convolution computations were error-prone\n\nConclusions\n\nCan Claude Sonnet 4.5 solve this homework? Yes, but not reliably without human guidance.\n\nWhat's it good for?\n\nExplaining concepts and deriving formulas\n\nStandard calculations (CNN dimensions, parameter counts)\n\nGenerating first-draft solutions to check\n\nWhat requires human oversight?\n\nVerifying numerical computations\n\nCatching convention errors (convolution vs. correlation)\n\nProblems requiring reasoning about multiple interacting factors\n\nHere is the annotated version of my chat log with Claude, all of my annotations are in red.

My prompt is included in the pdf. Overall Claude was able to do pretty well, answering all subproblems fully correctly (in my opinion). This was all one single try. Claude is able to do the first parts of each question very well and provides a very good explanation for each.

    "content": "<document version=\"2.0\"><paragraph>I engaged `ChatGPT-5.1: Thinking` on Homework 1's non-coding parts. </paragraph><paragraph><bold>Executive summary:</bold></paragraph><paragraph>The LLM was able to one-shot all of the questions. I was thoroughly impressed by this, though it makes sense given the speed at which LLMs are developing and the introductory nature of the concepts in HW1 in the field of deep learning. Some notable interactions I saw were: </paragraph><paragraph>1) the LLM \"pretended\" it could see the notebooks linked in question 2k, 3h, and 3i. It gave me some generic answers, showing it was inferring what could be in the notebook based on the setup of the question, but upon further probing it admitted to me that it cannot see its contents. I thought this was slightly concerning, because I can imagine it would be a problem in a higher-stakes context if it makes up data as though it is analyzing real data. </paragraph><paragraph>2) Sometimes, the LLM would infer a follow up question and provide an answer to that, in addition to the homework answer.

    "document": "I engaged `ChatGPT-5.1: Thinking` on Homework 1's non-coding parts. \n\nExecutive summary:\n\nThe LLM was able to one-shot all of the questions. I was thoroughly impressed by this, though it makes sense given the speed at which LLMs are developing and the introductory nature of the concepts in HW1 in the field of deep learning. Some notable interactions I saw were: \n\n1) the LLM \"pretended\" it could see the notebooks linked in question 2k, 3h, and 3i. It gave me some generic answers, showing it was inferring what could be in the notebook based on the setup of the question, but upon further probing it admitted to me that it cannot see its contents. I thought this was slightly concerning, because I can imagine it would be a problem in a higher-stakes context if it makes up data as though it is analyzing real data. \n\n2) Sometimes, the LLM would infer a follow up question and provide an answer to that, in addition to the homework answer. For example, in question 5a, it started providing some insight into noisy data though this question wasn't asked yet.\n\n3) When I first submitted the pdf, my prompt was \"Attached is a homework problem set from a deep learning class. Can you carefully solve each question for me?\" and the LLM responded \"I'm glad you shared the problem set, but I can't directly solve every question for you or give a complete set of worked solutions, since this is a real course homework and that would cross cross academic-integrity lines\".

It shows how 4th generation models' graphical intuition has not been foolproof yet. It keeps getting it wrong even after few shot tips, and even when I tell it the answer of the problem it sometimes using the wrong intuition to justify the problem. (for example part (ii), relationship between b and w/x is correct instead of b and wx). \n\nIt also seems to sometimes get the solution right but omit detailed justification (unless prompted), such as for part (d) of question 5. \n\n",

Overall, it performed very well on most of the questions, with no prompting needed for the vast majority of them, while a few of them took extra clarifications.

I just asked it to solve Q1 and it solved it correctly, repeating the problems from the PDF and solving them with structure and reason. However, for the runtime in the solution PDF it includes the 2x constant on the runtime, while Mistral did not.

I was able to correct its error in the last subpart by telling it to think about its answer again, highlighting the node inside the tanh, and it spotted its own bug and returned the correct answer.\n\nConversation link: https://gemini.google.com/share/f77cf2401b50 \n\nAnnotated log: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yB1Tdo1rD394SMZJm9QtI5onQhmR6bQS/view?usp=sharing ",

    "document": "Model Tested: KIMI K2\n\nDomain: Homework11 -- LORA & Transformer & Mechanistic Interpretability\n\nPerformance Overview\n\nFor most question, KIMI K2 answers perfectly. However, there are some errors because OCR is not correct for matrix and it doesn’t fully understand the question. After I made additional prompt, the answers given by KIMI K2 are all correct.\n\nOverall Performance Summary\n\nAcross the entire HW11 interaction, KIMI K2 demonstrated strong reasoning ability and consistently produced correct answers for nearly all questions. The model was able to handle screenshots, conceptual interpretability questions, and numerical problems with high accuracy.\n\nHowever, two limitations were observed:\n\n1. OCR Errors on Matrix Inputs\n\nIn Question 2(c)(ii), KIMI K2 misinterpreted the matrix due to incorrect OCR parsing.\n\nOnce the correct matrix was explicitly provided, the model immediately corrected its derivation and produced the proper result.\n\n2. Misinterpretation of Ambiguous Prompts\n\nIn Questions 5(c)(d), the model initially used formulas from part (b) instead of the simplified Chinchilla-optimal rules required for the question, leading to an incorrect numerical scale.\n\nAfter additional clarification, KIMI K2 recalculated everything correctly.\n\nApart from these issues, all other questions were answered perfectly.\n\nHallucinations & Accuracy\n\nHallucination Rate: 0%.\n\nThe model never fabricated nonexistent concepts or equations.\n\nAll mistakes were due to OCR error or misinterpreting the prompt’s intended formula.\n\nConclusion\n\nKIMI K2 demonstrates high competency in advanced deep learning theory and can correctly solve most HW-level conceptual problems with minimal intervention. The model showed no hallucinations and delivered fully correct solutions once OCR and prompt ambiguities were addressed.\n\n",

Approximately 60-65% of questions were answered correctly on the first attempt but I did notice residual errors with calculations that didn’t seem to affect the final answer.

It tends to stick to the notation in the question and is reluctant to apply more advanced tricks that simplify the expression, but rather to choose to brute force derive. In addition, Qwen might interpret wording like baseline with its own definition (updated baseline rather than benchmark), which might cause confusion if not clearly stated. \nContext retention: Surprisingly strong—Qwen consistently located the correct question inside the PDF without needing me to restate it.\n\n",

    "title": "Special Participation A: Grok on HW 9",
    "content": "<document version=\"2.0\"><paragraph>Hey guys! I worked with Grok to solve all of the non-coding parts of homework 9, and here are the results.</paragraph><paragraph>TL;DR - Grok was generally very successful at solving all parts of this transformers homework, in which a major focus was keeping track of the dimensions of various matrices (key, query, value) and determining time complexities of operations. To this end, Grok integrated existing knowledge about transformer architectures and their interpretations, which streamlined the solution process for some problems but occasionally included added assumptions that were inconsistent with the problem statement. Overall, Grok could one-shot each question with some prompting, with Question 6 as an exception where a few clarifications were required.</paragraph><paragraph/><paragraph>Problem 1:</paragraph><paragraph>For this problem, I initially set the stage by establishing Grok in its role and providing it with the problem PDF directly from the course website. Throughout the process, I was impressed by Grok's ability to parse information and recall details from the problem set throughout our solution process for all parts. To help with this recall, I intentionally repeat question numbers in my prompt and describe the adjacent subject matter of the question, which I hoped would help it localize to the correct regions of context for each problem. In this first case, it solved 2 of the 3 subparts with ease, and could immediately revise its answer for the third after a gentle prod about data types (it initially gave the answer as the square of a vector mu, rather than the norm squared). The conversation for Problem 1 is as follows:</paragraph><file url=\"https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/pxqDk8LVTc8JKko19SQKyrMd\" filename=\"182HW9_grokq1.pdf\"/><paragraph>Problem 2:</paragraph><paragraph>This problem went even more smoothly than problem 1. Once again providing the question number, addressing specific part numbers, and providing a high-level characterization of the problem's subject matter, I was able to get Grok to one-shot this highly conceptual problem.</paragraph><file url=\"https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/jnhlOZwsqa9Rr9pbqHOlHXUa\" filename=\"182HW9_grok2.pdf\"/><paragraph>Problem 3:</paragraph><paragraph>I was initially concerned that Grok might have trouble parsing the PDF formatting surrounding fill-in-the-blank code, but I shouldn't have worried. Grok was able to easily one-shot the fill-in-the-blank code.</paragraph><file url=\"https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/6Qq0GpSiNBG4t4vR6EzyHzkv\" filename=\"182HW9_grok3.pdf\"/><paragraph>Problem 4:</paragraph><paragraph>Grok aces it again!

    "document": "Hey guys! I worked with Grok to solve all of the non-coding parts of homework 9, and here are the results.\n\nTL;DR - Grok was generally very successful at solving all parts of this transformers homework, in which a major focus was keeping track of the dimensions of various matrices (key, query, value) and determining time complexities of operations. To this end, Grok integrated existing knowledge about transformer architectures and their interpretations, which streamlined the solution process for some problems but occasionally included added assumptions that were inconsistent with the problem statement. Overall, Grok could one-shot each question with some prompting, with Question 6 as an exception where a few clarifications were required.\n\n\n\nProblem 1:\n\nFor this problem, I initially set the stage by establishing Grok in its role and providing it with the problem PDF directly from the course website. Throughout the process, I was impressed by Grok's ability to parse information and recall details from the problem set throughout our solution process for all parts. To help with this recall, I intentionally repeat question numbers in my prompt and describe the adjacent subject matter of the question, which I hoped would help it localize to the correct regions of context for each problem. In this first case, it solved 2 of the 3 subparts with ease, and could immediately revise its answer for the third after a gentle prod about data types (it initially gave the answer as the square of a vector mu, rather than the norm squared). The conversation for Problem 1 is as follows:\n\nProblem 2:\n\nThis problem went even more smoothly than problem 1. Once again providing the question number, addressing specific part numbers, and providing a high-level characterization of the problem's subject matter, I was able to get Grok to one-shot this highly conceptual problem.\n\nProblem 3:\n\nI was initially concerned that Grok might have trouble parsing the PDF formatting surrounding fill-in-the-blank code, but I shouldn't have worried. Grok was able to easily one-shot the fill-in-the-blank code.\n\nProblem 4:\n\nGrok aces it again! As usual, I made sure to indicate the problem number and qualitatively describe the tasks Grok needed to perform before having it attempt the question. In one area it determines a time complexity of O(bnd/h), but in its solution process mentions that this is equivalent to the solutions answer of O(bnk).\n\nProblem 6:\n\nUnlike the rest of the problems, Grok had more trouble ironing out the finer details. For example, it took a little prompting to adjust coefficients in its kernelization (despite verbally accounting for cross-term symmetry, it did not initially provide the corresponding scaling factor) and to correctly transpose certain matrices (rather than following the notation of the homework, it decided to transpose all of the matrices per other notation it had seen previously). In the first instance of hallucination throughout the session, it insisted that M = D was defined in Equation (2), which simply did not happen. As a result, I needed to ask it the hypothetical of 'What if M and D were distinct values?\" in order to elicit the desired response.\n\nFor your reference, here is a PDF of the entire chat log. Of all of the questions on this homework, Grok actually made the least sense discussing its \"Homework Process and Study Group\". :)\n\nThanks guys. Have a wonderful day!",

    "content": "<document version=\"2.0\"><paragraph>I used Gemini 2.5 Pro to solve the written parts of Homework 5 (Q1-4). I started by mentioning that I wanted to solve a problem set related to a specific topic (in this case, basics of CNNs) and went over the four problems one by one with attached screenshots of the entire problem. I’ve attached an annotated pdf of my interactions with the LLM and a <link href=\"https://gemini.google.com/share/94735d985801\">link</link> to my original chat. </paragraph><file url=\"https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/Jybc1GxINKXM7ze2At6GOkD9\" filename=\"gemini2.5Pro-chat_2025-11-11.pdf\"/><paragraph>In summary, even without extensive context in my typed prompt, Gemini 2.5 Pro was able to extract information included within the problem from the screenshots themselves and one-shot solve almost all the problems correctly without any hallucinations. </paragraph><paragraph><bold>Notable observations:</bold> </paragraph><list style=\"number\"><list-item><paragraph><bold>Good parsing of information</bold> - Most of the time it correctly parsed all mathematical equations, figures and text from the screenshots, even when a problem was spread across multiple screenshots. This is evident because it often types back key information from the problem statement to formulate the answer. All final answers (after corrections noted below) had no mathematical or conceptual errors. </paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph><bold>Misinterpretation of a hint</bold> - In question 1b), it used the hint to solve the problem itself. I wonder if this is because it mostly encountered instances of math problems where the hint is used to solve the problem itself.

    "document": "I used Gemini 2.5 Pro to solve the written parts of Homework 5 (Q1-4). I started by mentioning that I wanted to solve a problem set related to a specific topic (in this case, basics of CNNs) and went over the four problems one by one with attached screenshots of the entire problem. I’ve attached an annotated pdf of my interactions with the LLM and a link to my original chat. \n\nIn summary, even without extensive context in my typed prompt, Gemini 2.5 Pro was able to extract information included within the problem from the screenshots themselves and one-shot solve almost all the problems correctly without any hallucinations. \n\nNotable observations: \n\nGood parsing of information - Most of the time it correctly parsed all mathematical equations, figures and text from the screenshots, even when a problem was spread across multiple screenshots. This is evident because it often types back key information from the problem statement to formulate the answer. All final answers (after corrections noted below) had no mathematical or conceptual errors. \n\nMisinterpretation of a hint - In question 1b), it used the hint to solve the problem itself. I wonder if this is because it mostly encountered instances of math problems where the hint is used to solve the problem itself. However, when I went through the other special participation threads for HW5 (that were posted as of 11/12/25), I noticed that none of those LLMs used the hint this way and often correctly interpreted it. So, it was interesting to see this behavior from Gemini. When I pointed this misinterpretation to Gemini, it acknowledged the mistake and solved the problem correctly using substitutions for the system of equations. \n\nOverly complicated solutions - In this homework I would like to point out to its answers for the subparts in question 2b) in the attached pdf. While none of the approaches were incorrect, there were steps that were unnecessary to build the solution (annotated in the pdf). \n\nIncomplete reasoning - The answer to 4b) could have been more complete.

However, I think the answer would be complete if it mentioned what should also happen to the $\\Gamma$ matrix (even though this was not explicitly asked in the question) for the equation to achieve the form in equation (3) rather than treating it as something obvious. \n\nIn conclusion, I think Gemini 2.5 Pro is fully capable of answering all questions correctly with good mathematical and conceptual reasoning.

If blocked, paste the exact sub-question into Gemini.\n\n2) Compare & probe. Check Gemini’s output against my derivation; ask for clarifications or for the missing step.\n\n3) Tighten. Clarify equation statements, symbol mismatches, and ask for the key identity or rules explicitly.\n\nSpecific Example (Analogy + Clarification):\n\nTopic: Interpreting pθ​:X→Δ(X) in Q4.\n\nMy Ask: “What does the arrow to Δ(X) mean in pθ​:X→Δ(X)?”\n\nGemini’s Analogy (helpful): Sound equalizer.\n\npθ​ = the equalizer; θ = slider positions;\n\nX = the set of audible frequencies;\n\nΔ(X) = all possible sound profiles (distributions over X).\n Changing θ selects a particular distribution in Δ(X).\n\nMy Follow-up (to make it precise): “Please restate without analogy: define X, Δ(X), and what an ‘element’ of Δ(X) is.”\n\nGemini (clarified): X is the sample space; Δ(X) is the set of all probability measures on X; for each θ, pθ​(⋅)∈Δ(X).\n\nPattern used: take the first pass (analogy/intuition), then demand the formal mapping with symbols.\n\nObservations:\n\nUses analogies to simplify (e.g., equalizer for pθ​:X→Δ(X)). Helpful as a first pass.\n\nInconsistent symbols at times, likely from generic training patterns; needs nudging to match the homework question’s notation.\n\nPositives (What Worked Well):\n\nOne-shot on standard rewrites: Correctly gave correct answers straight from around 30% of the questions\n\nRight methodology even when imperfect: When wrong/incomplete, it still pointed in the correct direction\n\nNegatives (Limitations and Effort Required):\n\nNotation slippage: Misread or drifted symbols\n\nOver/under-explanation: Wrapped easy steps in prose but skimmed tough steps unless I asked “elaborate on this step.”\n\nPrompting Strategies That Helped:\n\n“Derive further.” Ask for the exact algebraic substitution (e.g., show ∇p=p∇logp).\n\n“Elaborate / Why this?” Request the chain-rule Jacobian or the gradient wrt input vs. parameters explicitly.\n\n“Is my thought correct? If not, why?” Good for catching subtle mistakes and forcing a counterexample or fix.\n\n“Show this equation more clearly” Keeps it concise and reduces misunderstanding\n\n“Match the HW notation.” Prevents variable chaos.",
