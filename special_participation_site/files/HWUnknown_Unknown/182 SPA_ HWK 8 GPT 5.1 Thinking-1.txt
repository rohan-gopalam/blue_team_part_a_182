Note: I had originally signed up for HWK 7 GPT 5, but someone covered it, without adding to the 
deconflictation form; so I changed to HWK 8 GPT 5.1 Thinking (to my knowledge it used just 
thinking not normal mode). My formatting here is based on or at least influenced by participation 
assignments that other students did. 
 
Non-coding questions 
 
To compare correctness, I used the solutions and then attempted to prompt it further once into 
getting the correct answer (based on what the solutions said the correct answer was). 
Question 1 
a)​ First Try - solved the question 
b)​ First Try - solved the question 
c)​ Missed the O(logn) factor from matrix multiplication on the first try, succeeded the 
second time 
d)​ Brought up Divide and conquer, it doesn’t seem 100% the same as what the solutions 
have, but I will give this credit. Also it missed the O(logn) factor from matrix 
multiplication. The second time it got O(logL * Tmm) but Tmm is a matmat it previously 
said in c’s answer should be logn, so total is O(logL * logn) which is correct, but solution 
did not word it that way. 
e)​ Missed this on both runs 
f)​ Missed this on both runs 
Question 3 
a)​ First Try - solved the question 
b)​ First Try - solved the question 
c)​ The derivation might be different/incorrect but it does get to the right answer, so I will 
give it credit. 
​
Question 4 
a)​ First Try - solved the question correctly 
b)​ First Try - solved the question correctly 
c)​ First Try - solved the question correctly 
d)​ First Try - solved the question correctly 
e)​ First Try - solved the question correctly 
f)​ GPT says that the answer matches in substance to the solutions when re-prompted with 
the solutions

g)​ GPT says that the answer matches in substance to the solutions when re-prompted with 
the solutions 
 
Thoughts: This performed much better than the discussion I had heard previously on GPT’s 
ability to solve problems.
