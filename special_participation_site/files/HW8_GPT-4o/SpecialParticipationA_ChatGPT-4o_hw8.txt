The model was able to oneshot all problems, but 
even though I prompted the model to go step by step,
for some of the questions it just straight gave the answer 
without going through logic.

It didn’t take a look at the runtime based on n
and i tried to prompt it alot to kind of ﬁgure out the correct run
time based on n
This wasn’t that explanative, but it got it correct
They didn’t go that explicit into how fast 
/the runtime of this method for computation

I wanted to prod the model to  give more insight
 into what they were thinking.

Even after prompting the model to look at the 
dimensionality, it still wasn’t able to ﬁgure out the log n 
component

I had to push the model alot towards the computation time using parallel operations

after prodding the model for a better explanation it hit the correct runtime complexity

Model started hallucinating the problems when 
asking for it to be outputted in a latex ﬁle which is interesting. also it
just truncated all the messages even though i asked 
it to give me the whole conversation history.
