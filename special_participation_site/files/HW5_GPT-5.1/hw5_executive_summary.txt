ERIC's Special Participation A - ChatGPT-5.1 Pro on EECS 182 HW5
Testing Extended Thinking Capabilities on Written Problems
My Prompt to ChatGPT-5.1 Pro
Prompt: "Generate thorough solutions for HW5 problems 1-4. Show all work, be as accurate as possible, and
explain your reasoning clearly."
Model Response:
Entered extended thinking mode (approximately 30 minutes)
Generated comprehensive PDF with complete solutions
Single-shot output with no iteration required
Experimental Setup
LLM Tested: ChatGPT-5.1 Pro (with extended thinking)
Topic: EECS 182 Homework 5, Problems 1-4 (Written Problems)
Date: December 2025
Deconfliction: ChatGPT-5.1 Pro claimed in class spreadsheet
I tested ChatGPT-5.1 Pro's extended thinking capability by giving it a single prompt to solve all four written
problems from HW5. The model activated its "thinking mode," spent approximately 30 minutes reasoning
internally, then produced a comprehensive solution document as a PDF.
Key Findings
One-Shot Success Rate: 100%
All four problems were solved correctly on the first attempt:
Problem 1 (Convolutional Networks): ✓ Correct
Problem 2 (Batch Normalization): ✓ Correct
Problem 3 (Depthwise Separable Convolutions): ✓ Correct


--- Page 2 ---
Problem 4 (Regularization and Dropout): ✓ Correct
No human intervention, corrections, or follow-up prompts were needed.
Quality Observations:
All mathematical derivations show complete step-by-step work
Zero computational errors across ~10 pages of calculations
All numerical answers match official solutions exactly
Textbook-level explanations with proper mathematical formatting
No misconceptions or hallucinations detected
Conclusion
ChatGPT-5.1 Pro with extended thinking completely solves graduate-level deep learning homework with
perfect accuracy. The 30-minute thinking time produces solutions that match or exceed teaching staff quality in
clarity, completeness, and correctness.
Key Observation: For well-defined mathematical problems, this model demonstrates superhuman accuracy and
consistency. The extended thinking mode appears to provide internal verification and multi-perspective
reasoning that eliminates typical LLM errors.
Bottom Line: Every homework problem was one-shot correctly. Zero errors, zero hallucinations, zero need for
human guidance. This represents a fundamental shift in capability for LLMs on technical coursework.
Implications for EECS 182: Traditional "compute X" or "derive Y" homework is now fully automated. Any
problem with a definite correct answer (derivations, calculations, parameter counting) can be perfectly solved
by this model. Course design should shift toward conceptual "explain why" questions requiring insight, open-
ended design problems, and creative synthesis of multiple concepts.
