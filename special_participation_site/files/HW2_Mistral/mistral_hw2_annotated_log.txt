First, I provide a prepared guideline 
prompt for the LLM to better 
understand what and how to do the 
following tasks, encourage it to give 
more organized,convinced and 
detailed answers.
Here the Mistral convert the 
original problem into a 
equivalent formula which rescale 
the alpha. There is no harm 
doing this but we hope it follows 
the original question settings.


--- Page 2 ---
I explicitly remind mistral to 
follow the original problem setting 
of alpha.


--- Page 3 ---
Correct answer for question 1a) after 
1 follow-up reminder.


--- Page 6 ---
Here, for question 1b) the mistral gave 
an obviously wrong answer. So first, I 
tried to give a straightforward reminder 
which points out a term that should be 
included in the right answer.


--- Page 7 ---
Although I pointed out the correct 
components, the mistral still insisted 
its previous solution. So this time, I 
indicate an apparent paradox in its 
reasoning.


--- Page 9 ---
After reminding it that we can 
explicitly write out the minimum 
term, the mistral indeed wrote out it 
but in a wrong answer. So I directly 
told it the right result of the 
minimum term.


--- Page 10 ---
After the correction, the mistral 
refused it and came back to its 
original fault which is a existing 
result of a specific problem. We 
can deduce that the mistral lazily 
copy the answer from its learning 
materials instead of reasoning 
under the given problem settings. 
So I forced it to follow the 
mathematical chain and explicitly 
provided the correct component 
of the final answer.


--- Page 11 ---
For question 1b, The Mistral got the right 
final answer after 4 follow-up correction.


--- Page 13 ---
Mistral one-shot the question 2a


--- Page 14 ---
For question 2b, Mistral gave the same 
answer as the 2a and made some mistakes 
when including the Adam matrix Mt. So for 
the follow-up guidance, I emphasized the 
difference between the 2 problems and 
remind it of the effect of the matrix M


--- Page 16 ---
The answer stuck to the previous. 
So I explicitly pointed out the 
correct direction of the gradients.


--- Page 18 ---
After 2 follow-up guidance, it got the correct 
answer for question 2b.


--- Page 19 ---
The mistral wrongly understood the 
rescaling statement in the problem 
context. So I re-explain it a bit to help 
it reasoning.


--- Page 20 ---
For question 2c, it got correct 
answer with 1 guidance.


--- Page 21 ---
For question 5, one-shot!
