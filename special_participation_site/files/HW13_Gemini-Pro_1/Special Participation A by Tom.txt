Solving Homework 13 with Gemini 3.0 Pro 
Firstly, I tried Question 2: 
# Round 1: By explicitly defining the persona as a 'Deep Learning Specialist' and 'Patient 
Mentor', I steered the model away from generic, brief answers. This prompted it to structure 
the response with 'Key Knowledge Pillars' before diving into the math, which significantly 
aided conceptual understanding. 
 
# Round 2: OCR Stress Test: The input image contained dense mathematical notation (e.g., 
partition function definitions). Gemini 3.0 Pro recognized the inline LaTeX correctly without 
manual transcription.

# Round 3 and so on: Solving the problem part by part with clear explainations. 
 
Here appears a small notation problem but does not effect understanding.

I verified this derivation manually. The model successfully applied the algebraic inversion to 
express the reward r(x,y) in terms of the optimal policy \pi*, which is the fundamental 
theorem of DPO.

As you can see, it not only provides structured answers, but also explains the importance and 
the behind logic why we are doing these steps. I think they are very helpful for learners.

Special Participation A: Gemini 3.0 Pro on Homework 13 
 
For this assignment, I evaluated how well Gemini 3.0 Pro can handle the theoretical, non-
coding derivations of CS182 Homework 13. I approached the Direct Preference Optimization 
(DPO) problem set step-by-step, initiating the session with a specific persona prompt to 
establish a "technical partner" role, and then guided the model through the derivation without 
providing the final answers myself. My main goal was to see (1) its OCR accuracy on dense 
mathematical problem sets, (2) its ability to perform rigorous algebraic manipulations, and (3) 
the clarity of its conceptual explanations. 
 
Overall, Gemini performed exceptionally well. It correctly identified the context from the 
uploaded images and produced clean, structured derivations for the entire pipeline (Q2 Parts 
a through g) with minimal correction required. 
 
It was especially reliable on: 
 
Interpreting the standard RLHF objective and KL constraints, 
 
Executing the algebraic "cancellation trick" to eliminate the intractable partition function Z(x), 
 
Deriving the gradient of the DPO loss and interpreting the weighting mechanism, and 
 
Extending the logic from pairwise comparisons to listwise rankings (Plackett-Luce model). 
 
In terms of interaction, the model was: 
 
consistent in its LaTeX formatting and structure, and 
 
highly effective at explaining the "why" behind each step, acting as a true mentor rather than 
just a calculator. 
 
Overall, based on this evaluation, Gemini 3.0 Pro is capable of solving the complex theoretical 
questions in CS182 with high accuracy and interpretability.
