For Special Participation A, I used ChatGPT4o on several parts of HW7. Overall, it was 
helpful but revealed important limitations. ChatGPT4o excels at high-level conceptual 
explanations—providing clear insights on autoencoders, PCA, and sequence models— 
And it’s also fairly strong with mathematical computations.  
A notable issue occurred on Question 7(b), where ChatGPT4o initially gave an incorrect 
answer about decoder tokens during training and resisted correction when I first pointed 
out the mistake. This highlighted the need to persistently challenge responses that seem 
wrong rather than accepting them at face value. 
Despite these challenges, ChatGPT4o answer are insightful and deepened my 
understanding. 
 
I gave the following prompt to start  
 
Question 3b:
