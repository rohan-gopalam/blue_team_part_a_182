It might be more convenient to upload the entire document. 
However, uploading the entire document can make the answer very 
long and each subpart answer too concise. Therefore I upload it by 
copy-paste from the homework a question at a time.
The model gives me the shape of the derivative, which is helpful for warm-up.

Le Chat answers question 2 correctly. 
It is not suprising since question 2 is basic calculus and 
the conclusion is mostly given in the question.

The AI clearly gives me the dimension of the 
matrices, allowing me to track my calculations, 
which is very helpful for beginners.
Also the question cautions me about 
dimensions. Mistral AI is careful with that.

Mistral AI does not give the interpretations as the 
homework solution do. But the answer is still correct and 
concise.

Mistral AI gives very helpful summaries at the end.
In this way I can really gain insight and intuition of 
pseudoinverse.
I am a little bit rusty on SVD when doing HW0.

I understood, so no follow-up on SVD. (Comment: next time I should work through a concrete example)
Mistral AI gives explanation of FULL SVD, which is just what the homework asks me to perform.
After careful computation, I find the solution of this example to be:
I was not patient enough to calculate this previously.
I did not prompt Mistral AI again since this is brute force
computation (no need for AI).

The model correctly describes the shrinkage effect but doesn't connect it intuitively to the problem of ill-conditioning. 
It misses the opportunity to explain that λ acts as a stabilizer, preventing the term (σ_i² + λ)⁻¹ from blowing up when σ_i is very small.

The model's solution is overly terse. It states "Using the Woodbury identity..." without showing the steps. 
A strong solution would explicitly show the equivalence: w = Xᵀ(XXᵀ + λI)⁻¹y = (XᵀX + λI)⁻¹Xᵀy.
I understand this identity from my statistics course, but using it directly may defeat the purpose of this hw.
Deriving this equivalence is non-trivial and is the key to understanding the connection between the primal 
and dual forms of Ridge Regression. (The model provides the "what" but often skips the "why" or the "how"
for the more challenging steps. It treats non-trivial linear algebra identities as black boxes, which hinders 
deep understanding.)

One-shot correct answer.
Mistral AI’s explanation is not as detailed as the homework solution, but I 
understand it. That is probably because the question is very long. 
Which means giving it the entire homework is not a great idea.

For part b, Mistral AI does not consider the 
magnitude of the movement, resulting in 
neglected scenarios.

I hinted Mistral AI to redo part b with case-by-case analysis. Mistral AI gives 
the correct answer this time.

This problem requires a careful, quantitative analysis of how the ratio -b/w (the elbow) changes. 
The model's initial failure and subsequent correction highlight that it can struggle with problems requiring 
conditional reasoning based on the interaction of multiple parameters. Its language also lacks the precision 
required for rigorous mathematical communication.
