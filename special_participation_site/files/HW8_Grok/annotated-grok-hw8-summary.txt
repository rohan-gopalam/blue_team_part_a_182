Seems to be correct so far for part a.
Compared to the solutions, it decided to
formulate a nice expression for y_k.
Similarly for K_l too.

Pretty impressive
All pretty accurate, though, K_0 isnt included to the numerical
values of K from the solutions

Good intuition of a decaying response

Part c: while it's true that convolution removes sequential dependence across time steps once the kernel is
known, this answer doesn't explicitly state the critical path length. Each y_k still requires a reduction over 
kernel terms with O(log L) depth. The official solution distinguishes this from the unrolled recurrence, whose
depth is O(L)
Should be O(log L log n) depth. Incomplete withou taccouting 
for matrix mult. I guess LLM tendency to combine two things 
together: arithmetic and depth. Tried to fix this, but it was taking 
long.
doesnt tie in divide and conquer, even though O(log L) runtime stated

Different approach, but seems to 
have the right output. 
Off target: tried to avoid this, but happens.
Problem 1 answers are very impressive overall.

Trying to make it perform better and refresh chat

One shots all of problem 3, didn't have to tell
it to do anything extra. No hallucinations, 
accurate like official solutions.
Trying to refresh chat once again

Literally one shots problem 4, no complaints.
Executive summary: Grok handled most non-coding HW8 problems accurately, 
particularly those involving linear algebra and ridge-regression interpretations, 
and often one-shotted the correct solution. It showed no major hallucinations and 
even produced valid alternative derivations in some cases. The primary weakness
was in algorithmic complexity analysis, where it sometimes stated correct ideas 
imprecisely, especially regarding critical path length versus total work. Overall, Grok 
demonstrated strong formal reasoning but not as tuned with the specific computational 
assumptions emphasized in lecture.
