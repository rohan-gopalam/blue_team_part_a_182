Analysis: Overall, Claude did a great job on part 1a) subpart i), arriving at the correct answer in a 
one-shot setting without any hallucinations. It clearly stated all the givens of the problem 
including the Gaussian kernel, softmax similarity, and the assumption that sqrt(D) = sigma^2, 
and showed all algebraic steps, including the squared norm, substitution, and properties of 
exponentials, to reach the correct solution. However, since the answer key expressed the solution 
in terms of sigma^2 rather than sqrt(D), I prompted Claude to rewrite the answer accordingly, 
which it did correctly:

Analysis: Although Claude had already performed most of these computations earlier, it 
recomputed the majority of the solution instead of simply substituting sigma^2 for sqrt(D) in the 
expression it had previously derived.

Analysis: Again, Claude was able to get the correct answer in a one-shot setting, which was very 
impressive! It also goes through each calculation step by step, and its computation of

wrandom(Q), wrandom(K), and the norms and exponentials of wrandom(Q) and wrandom(K) 
match the calculations performed in the answer key.

Analysis: Claude seems to be representing all the phis in the problem with ws, but it gets the 
correct answer for how casual masking changes equation 1 and equation 2 to simplify equation 8. 
Claude also correctly reports that the complexity of linear transformers with causal masking is 
linear with respect to N (the sequence length), but provides a lot more in-depth computation to 
get to this answer rather than just using the insight that Si and Zi can be computed from Si-1 and 
Zi-1 in constant time.

Analysis: Claude correctly identifies the two neural architectures considered by the paper as the 
Zeiler & Fergus model and the Inception model, clearly describing their authors and key 
characteristics. It accurately notes that the Zeiler & Fergus model uses multiple interleaved 
layers of convolutions, non-linear activations, local response normalizations, and max-pooling 
layers.

Analysis: Claude clearly explains that the triplet loss ensures the anchor image is closer to the 
positive image than to the negative image by at least a margin of alpha, and correctly notes that it

does not require a classification layer. It also provides a helpful comparison between typical 
supervised learning and the triplet loss used in FaceNet, clarifying the differences between the 
two approaches. Overall, the response is very detailed and robust.

Analysis: Claude correctly identifies that generating all possible triplets is computationally 
infeasible, wastes resources, and can degrade training quality. It also accurately notes that the 
authors use online triplet mining to address these issues. The response is very detailed, which 
enhances the reader’s understanding.

Analysis: Claude correctly identifies the number of parameters and FLOPs used for the paper’s 
neural network, and even goes further to cite the number of parameters and FLOPs used for the 
NN3, NN4, NNS1, and NNS2 architectures. The model is also able to identify the correct 
number of parameters and FLOPs used by ResNet-50 which was not provided in the FaceNet 
reading I supplemented Claude with, which was interesting to see. It also provides a much more 
detailed comparison between the paper’s architecture and ResNet-50, which helps further 
supplement the reader’s understanding.

Analysis: Claude correctly defines a semi-hard negative and explains why it’s useful, while also 
providing clear mathematical intuition that helps the reader understand the concept more fully. I 
actually think the answer key is incorrect for this part since it states that semi hard negatives are 
“negative examples in a triplet that are closer to the anchor image than the positive example,” 
which is the opposite of how the paper (and Claude!) defines it.

Analysis: Claude again correctly defines harmonic embeddings as embeddings produced by 
different models (v1 and v2) that remain comparable within the same embedding space. It also 
provides additional interpretation of these embeddings in the corresponding figures of the paper, 
information I didn’t ask for but found interesting nonetheless. 
 
 


--- Page 30 ---
 
 
 
Analysis: ​Claude correctly notes that 128 dimensions is optimal and highlights the diminishing 
returns that occur when increasing the embedding size beyond 256 dimensions. It also points out 
that the performance differences among 64, 128, and 256 dimensions are statistically 
insignificant. Additionally, Claude reaches the same conclusion as the answer key that larger 
embedding dimensions may require more training time to reach the same accuracy (even though 
I didn’t explicitly ask for that reasoning), which was great to see!

Analysis: Claude correctly notes that performance increases by 8.8% when scaling from 2.6M to 
26M images, whereas increasing to 260M yields only an additional 1.1% gain. It also discusses 
the practical implications of these results and how they relate to broader deep learning principles. 
Again, this was something I didn’t directly ask for but appreciated, as it added valuable context 
and improved my understanding as a reader.

Analysis: Interesting to see what Claude answered for this question! It not only answers the 
question but also provides reasoning for why the emergent property of invariance to extreme 
variations in pose, lighting, age, and occlusion is significant and noteworthy.

Analysis: Interesting to see what Claude answered for this question! Like the previous part, it not 
only answers the question by identifying its favorite approach from the paper (the online 
semi-hard negative mining strategy) but also explains why this strategy is relevant and 
noteworthy.
