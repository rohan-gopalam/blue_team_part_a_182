Special Participation A: ChatGPT on HW1 
• Introduction 
 At first, I simply gave ChatGPT the command “Solve this” along with a screenshot of the problem. 
However, the responses were not very good, so I consulted with ChatGPT to refine and create a more 
appropriate initial command. Also, since it tended to misread small images, I made sure to take larger 
screenshots. 
 
Note:  
ChatGPT was set to Thinking mode. 
In the following, the gray sections represent the commands, the uncolored sections are ChatGPT’s 
responses, and the red text contains my commentary on ChatGPT’s answers.

• Interactions 
You are a large language model being evaluated for your ability to reason through graduate-level machine 
learning theory questions without coding. I will give you one question at a time as an image (each image 
corresponds to one subproblem of a homework assignment).  
 
Your goal is to:  
Read and interpret the problem correctly.  
Produce the analytical or conceptual solution, showing intermediate reasoning.  
Avoid hallucinating or making up definitions — if information is missing, explicitly say so.  
Answer in a way suitable for a graduate student homework (clear math notation and concise justification).  
After each answer, I will interactively challenge or clarify parts of your reasoning.  
 
Rules:  
You may use LaTeX-style math notation (Δθ, ‖·‖₂, etc.).  
Do not skip derivation steps.

Think step-by-step but write concisely.  
If the problem contains multiple subparts (a), (b), (c), answer each clearly.  
 
Once ready, I will start by giving you the first question image. Please confirm you understand the task. 
 
Got it—I understand the task and the rules. 
When you send each image, I will: 
1. restate the problem in my own words to confirm interpretation, 
2. solve it step-by-step with clear intermediate derivations, 
3. flag any missing information or ambiguous assumptions, 
4. present final results in clean math notation, with each subpart (a), (b), (c) labeled. 
Please share the first question image when you’re ready. 
 
1. Why Learning Rates Cannot be Too Big 
This is input. 思考時間 is thinking time because my language setting is Japanese.

All of ChatGPT’s answers were correct. A notable characteristic of its responses was a tendency to present the 
solutions in a highly mathematical manner. In particular, for problem (g), the explanation was more 
mathematical than necessary. This is likely because the initial command included the phrase “showing 
intermediate reasoning.

2. Stochastic Gradient Descent (when it is possible to interpolate) 
Input is below. This consideration needs more than 5 minutes. 
 
Output is below.

In problem (b), ChatGPT mistakenly eliminated (ignored) the U matrix when simplifying 
Xw' = UΣV^T w' = 0  to  Σw'' = 0. As a result, all subsequent problems except (e) were answered 
incorrectly, since they relied on this mistaken step. However, given the incorrect assumption in (b), 
ChatGPT’s reasoning and solutions were internally consistent and correct within that framework. This 
shows that ChatGPT solved the questions sequentially, building upon its previous answers. 
 
So I gave ChatGPT a hit below. 
Please re-solve the entire problem. I believe there was a mistake in the SVD coordinate transformation in 
part (b). Hint: When you analyzed $Xw' = 0$ using the SVD $X = U\Sigma V^T$ and $w'' = V^T w'$, 
you simplified the system to $\Sigma w'' = 0$. However, the $U$ matrix should not be dropped. The 
correct simplification is $U\Sigma w'' = 0$. This implies the new system matrix $\tilde{X}$ (from 
equation 15) should be $\tilde{X} = U\Sigma$, not just the diagonal matrix $\Sigma$. Could you please 
re-derive the solutions for all parts (especially c, d, h, i) starting from this corrected transformation? 
 
Output is as follows.

By providing a hint, ChatGPT was able to reach the correct answer. 
The nature of this failure is quite interesting. ChatGPT did not make an arithmetic mistake; rather, it 
performed a “conceptual oversimplification”—it incorrectly simplified UΣw’’=0 to Σw’’=0. This shows 
that the LLM ignored the broader context (in this case, the row-wise analysis of SGD in parts (c) and 
beyond) and instead made a locally valid transformation (since U is invertible) that did not align with the 
overall goal of the problem. 
Moreover, the fact that ChatGPT arrived at the correct answer once a hint was provided suggests that it is 
particularly strong at conditional reasoning when given scaffolding—that is, when guided with structured 
hints or intermediate support.

For this problem as well, ChatGPT spent more than five minutes thinking. All of its answers were correct. 
Similar to Problem 1, ChatGPT showed a tendency to present its solutions in a highly mathematical 
manner. For the reasoning and explanation questions (h) and (i), it again provided more mathematical 
detail than was necessary.

4. Optimizers

For this problem, ChatGPT solved it almost immediately. This is probably because part (a) simply asked about 
the structure of Adam, so there was little need for deeper reasoning. All of ChatGPT’s answers were correct, 
though there were some minor differences in notation in its responses. 
 
5. Regularization and Instance Noise

Although it took about two minutes, all of ChatGPT’s answers were correct, and it was able to solve the 
problem by following the given hint.

ChatGPT’s answer is correct. Following the instructions in the problem statement and combining them 
with the given assumption (that equation (102) is also a MAP estimate), it demonstrated that (102) and 
(103) are equivalent. 
In addition, ChatGPT provided a proof showing that the two expressions are algebraically identical by 
explicitly proving the matrix identity (𝑋⊤𝑋+ 𝜆𝐼)−1𝑋⊤= 𝑋⊤(𝑋𝑋⊤+ 𝜆𝐼)−1.

This identity was mentioned in the problem statement, but since it was unclear whether it could be used 
without proof, ChatGPT appears to have derived it explicitly. 
 
• Summary 
 Overall, ChatGPT achieved fully correct answers for all problems, demonstrating strong mathematical 
reasoning and consistency across sequential tasks. However, the interaction also revealed distinctive 
behavioral patterns in how the model approached problem solving. 
1. Accuracy and One-Shot Performance 
o 
For straightforward conceptual or definitional questions (e.g., explaining optimizer structures 
or interpreting results), ChatGPT often produced the correct answer immediately (“one-
shot”). 
o 
For more complex derivations or matrix manipulations, it sometimes made conceptual 
simplification errors rather than arithmetic ones. Nevertheless, this resulted in only one error 
out of seven big problems. 
2. Example of Conceptual Oversimplification 
o 
In one problem, the model incorrectly dropped the 𝑈matrix when simplifying 𝑋𝑤′ =
𝑈Σ𝑉⊤𝑤′ = 0to Σ𝑤′′ = 0. 
o 
This error propagated through subsequent parts, showing that ChatGPT solved sequentially, 
building upon its previous reasoning. 
o 
Once provided with a hint, it immediately corrected the mistake—illustrating that the model 
is particularly strong at conditional reasoning with scaffolding. 
3. Style of Reasoning 


--- Page 31 ---
31 
 
o 
ChatGPT consistently produced mathematically formal and symbol-heavy responses, 
sometimes more rigorous than the problem required. 
o 
Especially for “explanation” questions, it tended to over-mathematize rather than summarize 
intuitively. This pattern was observed across multiple sub-questions. 
4. Response Latency and Thoughtfulness 
o 
The model typically took 2–5 minutes for moderately complex derivations, suggesting that its 
“Thinking” mode encouraged stepwise symbolic reasoning rather than rapid generation. 
5. Notation and Presentation 
o 
All responses were logically consistent with the official solutions, though small notational 
differences (e.g., transposition order or matrix symbols) occasionally appeared. 
o 
When a matrix identity was mentioned but not proven in the problem statement, ChatGPT 
sometimes derived it explicitly, reflecting uncertainty about whether it could assume the 
result.
