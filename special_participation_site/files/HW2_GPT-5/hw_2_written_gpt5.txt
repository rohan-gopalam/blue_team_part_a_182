Special Participation A: Homework 2 with GPT-5 
 
Executive summary: In this special participation, I interactively engage GPT-5 on the non-coding 
parts of Homework 2. My experience using it was boring and it one-shotted every question. I did 
not have to use any special strategies or gesture towards an answer to make it answer the 
problems correctly. I noticed one slight misconception in its reference to SignSGD and one 
missing transpose that made a column vector into a row vector. For the most part, it was 
hallucination free. However, it did actually manage to point out a typo on the homework on part 
(b) of problem 2, deducing that the problem is incorrect and is “ill-posed.” 
 
First, I make sure to utilize chain-of-thought by selecting GPT-5 Thinking at the top.

For convenience, I use ChatGPT’s image prompting feature since I do not want to type the 
homework LaTeX out.
 
I first feed the raw question to the model to see what it can do with it. It infers that it needs to 
complete (a). It one-shots it perfectly, without any text prompting strategy at all. This is notated 
pretty close to the staff solution as well which I attach here for reference.

Here I try the same strategy with (b), only to realize that my version of (b) is wrong. Interestingly, 
it catches the error in the problem, but does not infer what the problem should be.

Here, I prompt it with the actual problem I obtained from another pdf. It one-shots it again. I’m 
pretty sure that the math checks out as well. One slight misconception is that it refers to this as 
SignSGD even though SignSGD doesn’t scale by the 1-norm of the gradient.

Doing problem 2, it one-shots the problem again. There is not much of interest here besides 
that.

GPT-5 one-shots this problem as well. One minor nitpick is that it doesn’t add a transpose, so 
the optimal theta is a row vector even though it should be a column vector. Besides that, this 
solution is unremarkable.

This makes the same mistake of framing theta star as a row vector. It also writes a prime as a 
row vector as well. Other than that, the solution is fine. 
 
I skip the next two problems and also (7) since they’re coding problems.

The last problem (5) was done in one shot as well very quickly. The answers check out with the 
solutions. It took a mere 4 seconds for me to get a response. Interestingly, the message is very 
laconic and non-conversational. I have two hypotheses for why this happened: maybe the 
answer structure (fill in the blank) caused this, or the backend used a router to send me to a

different model, likely Thinking mini.
