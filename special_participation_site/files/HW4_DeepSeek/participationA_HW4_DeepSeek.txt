Asking DeepSeek how it would prefer to receive the questions. Sequential questioning was suggested.
Question 1 was answered correctly in one-shot.
Asked the question using an image of the question.


--- Page 3 ---
Trouble in solving Question 2. Asked the entire
question purely in text.


--- Page 6 ---
This inequality is wrong. 
It mixed the inequality with RMS
norm and 2-norm, without an 
appropriate scaling factor.


--- Page 7 ---
It forgot to utlize the c
mutiple from part b.
Same mistake as part d.
Conceptual sub-part asnwered correctly.
No relation to the incorrect math from the previous
sub-parts.


--- Page 8 ---
Did not identify that \sqrt(d_n) and \sqrt(d_in)
are the same.


--- Page 9 ---
Further prompting, nudging it to the right direction. Mistakes were made again.
Did not account for the scalar c.
Consequently part d and e also are incorect.


--- Page 10 ---
Same mistake continued, needed to
approach differently.


--- Page 11 ---
Prompt nudging to correct itself in part c, and hoping to get the d and e parts.


--- Page 12 ---
Correct, and the next parts also followed.


--- Page 13 ---
Wrong again.


--- Page 14 ---
Basicaly, answered the question. But asked to think about the scaling part of the question.


--- Page 15 ---
Finally correct.
Two pictures simultaneously provided.
Answered correctly, except in part d. Ran out of output limit to perform
the convolution.


--- Page 23 ---
Prompted to force an output for part d.
Answered the question correctly, although took a
lot of time and computation.
Did not finisht the answer. It says space is the reason for not performing this computation explicitly.


--- Page 34 ---
Asked the question as a mix of text and image. Solved it correctly. Also left out part f
to check its retaining capacity.


--- Page 39 ---
A mix of text and PDF. Answered this sub-part correctly. 
Retained information from the previous prompt properly.

Last Question asked using a PDF.
Answered everything correctly.
