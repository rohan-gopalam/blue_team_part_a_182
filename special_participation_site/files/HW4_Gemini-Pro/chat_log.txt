Fully correct! The 
square in the bottom is 
a pdf conversion error 
and was not present in 
the chat.
Fully correct construction 
(calculating W^tW first), 
and fully correct answer. 
(the square in the bottom is 
another conversion error).

Correct! I think the model 
looked at the link for this 
one.
Fully correct!


--- Page 4 ---
Fully correct; does the 
bound how we usually do it.
Latex had no error on the 
original website. Derivation 
is correct.

This is different from the solution, but as far 
as I can see, it is correct. The constant c 
should be irrelevant here (alternatively, we 
already accounted for it when deriving the 
bound for delta W’s norm), so I think 
Gemini is right here.
Fully correct!
Fully correct as well!

Slightly less general than the actual solution, but 
clear that the model knows what it’s doing.
Anecdotally, I made the same assumption when I 
did this homework.

Fully correct!

This is fully correct, and did not have display 
bugs on the website.
This is also fully correct, and did not have display 
bugs on the website.

Fully correct!
Fully correct!
One of the two reasonable approaches. Didn’t 
turn into big O notation but otherwise good.

It looks like Gemini didn’t include the fact that 
we usually double the amount of channels here 
above? Otherwise correct.
Fully correct (numbers on the left are just 
multiplied out).
It looks like Gemini didn’t see x_3 and x_4 in 
the actual question?

Image of x_3 and x_4
fully correct!

fully correct!
This is fully correct, except it didn’t write it as a 
cross-correlation.


--- Page 13 ---
Fully correct! The squared for the sigmas are 
actually displayed as squares on the original 
website.
This part is actually the fully correct solution.
This part is fully correct as well.

Good explanations! The Invariance and 
Information Preservation parts match the 
solution.
I was curious whether or not Gemini could 
write part a. as a cross-correlation (and notice 
that it’s a cross-correlation as well).
Correct cross-correlation!
