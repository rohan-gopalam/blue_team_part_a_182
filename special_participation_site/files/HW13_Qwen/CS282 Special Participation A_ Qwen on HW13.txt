CS282 Special Participation A: Qwen on 
HW13​
Executive Summary​
I use Qwen to solve HW13 written part in this special participation A.​
Qwen's accuracy really impressed me. All questions, including requiring proofs (e.g., induction 
in diffusion models), derivations (e.g., DPO gradients), or conceptual explanations (e.g., 
intractability of partition functions), were answered correctly and comprehensively in a single 
attempt, with no need for clarification or correction. The responses included rigorous 
mathematical detail, proper notation, and logical step-by-step reasoning.​
There is no factual inaccuracies, fabricated citations, or conceptual errors were observed. For 
instance:​
•
The derivation of the optimal policy in DPO correctly recovered the Gibbs form and explained 
the cancellation of the partition function in Bradley-Terry and Plackett-Luce models.​
•
The diffusion process proofs aligned exactly with standard results from the literature (e.g., Ho 
et al., 2020).​
•
Interpretations (e.g., gradient weighting in DPO reflecting model uncertainty) were insightful 
and technically sound.​
Despite minimal input context (only image placeholders uploaded), the model inferred the likely 
content (standard theoretical ML problems) and provided complete, self-contained solutions, 
demonstrating strong contextual awareness and domain knowledge. Responses were well-
organized, labeled by sub-question, and included boxed final answers where appropriate, 
enhancing readability and correctness verification.​
