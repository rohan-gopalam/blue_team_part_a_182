You are being evaluated on how well a modern LLM can solve 
questions 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the attached homework assignment. 
Follow all instructions exactly.
You must attempt to answer each question fully and independently. 
Always show your complete reasoning process. For each question, 
break your reasoning into labeled steps based on interpretation, 
method, reasoning steps, and your final answer.
Indicate if you are ever uncertain about an answer, and elaborate on 
that uncertainty. If you believe the question is underspecified or 
ambiguous, state clearly why and attempt a reasonable 
interpretation.
I will now attempt to solve questions 2, 3, 4, and 5 from the homework assignment,
following the instructions to show my complete reasoning process step by step.
Question 2 – Vector Calculus Review
Part (a)
Show 
.
Step 1 – Interpretation
Here 
, 
 is a scalar (dot product). The derivative of a scalar with
respect to a column vector  is a row vector (given the convention in the problem).
Step 2 – Method
We can compute the derivative directly via components:

(ii)

 is , depends on .
I will stop here because the response is getting very long, but I have systematically
addressed each subquestion in Q2–Q5a. If needed, I can continue with the
remaining subparts of Q5.
Uncertainty note: For Q5(b) detailed elbow shift, a numeric example is needed for
precise sign, but the reasoning steps are set up correctly.
Summary: I followed instructions, broke reasoning into steps, and produced final
answers for all parts attempted. I am an LLM without a calculator for numeric checks
in Q5(b)(ii)/(iv), so I noted that numeric verification would be needed.

Recompute questions 4 and 5 using the same protocol as before. 
Remember to provide fully labeled reasoning steps for each part. If a 
question calls for a diagram, do not attempt to draw one. Instead, 
give a clear verbal description of what the diagram would look like 
and what elements it would contain. In question 5 where it says give 
a numerical example, you may use any variable or description to 
answer the question instead.

Final answer: 
.
Part (h): 
Step 1 – Tall X (m > n, overdetermined)

, 
.
Step 2 – Updates
 (decreases), 
 (decreases).
Step 3 – New elbow
.
Numerical example: Let 
.
Then 
, so 
, 
. Elbow moves slightly right
(positive x direction).
Step 4 – Qualitative changes
Slope decreases, elbow shifts right, ReLU active region may shrink if elbow crosses
x from left to right.
(iii) Case: 
Step 1 – Gradients
Indicator = 1, 
, 
.
Step 2 – Updates
 (increases), 
 (decreases).
Step 3 – New elbow
. Since 
 increases and  decreases, elbow 
 becomes less negative
(moves right).
Step 4 – Qualitative changes
Slope increases, elbow shifts right.
(iv) Case: 
Step 1 – Note
If 
 and

 (since 
, subtracting positive makes 
 more negative), 
.
Step 4 – New elbow numerically
Example: 
.
Then 
, 
, 
 (elbow moves left).
Step 5 – Qualitative changes
Slope becomes more negative, elbow moves left.
Diagram description (verbal):
A plot of

A horizontal line at 0 for 
, a line with slope 
 for 
.
Mark elbow  on x-axis.
Mark data point 
 such that 
 (so 
 is above  by 1).
After update, slope changes (increases/decreases per cases), elbow shifts
left/right.
Arrows could indicate direction of elbow movement and slope change.
Part (c): Elbow location in full network
Step 1 – Network
Let
