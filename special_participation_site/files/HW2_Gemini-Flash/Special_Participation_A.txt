These examples turn out to mislead the LLM to 
give partially correct answers. When asked the 
questions of specific optimizers, Gemini tends to 
cover all of them deliberately.
This part is for Gemini to give a well-organized
 answer with clear structure and detailed 
explanations.
Each problem is provided in a text form. I tried 
to simply use the textual content to lead the 
LLM to give correct answers instead of feeding
 it with the whole document or the screenshot 
of the problem.
However the last problem contains a image 
which is necessary for LLM to understand.

The form of the formula turns out to be not a 
problem. Gemini can understand and restate it
 quite well.

Here's the partially correct answer. Actually GD
 is enough, but Gemini seems want to cover 
every example(in the next part it used the other 
2 examples) given in the original prompt.
Actually this happens in normal 
communications too, when you want to help the
 LLM form a better point of view to some 
problems, it's not a good choice to give them 
specific examples. Although I mean to help it 
understand better with the provided examples, it
 actually misleads it.

Same problem as above. 
Gemini misuses the examples in
 the prompt.
Correct Gemini's behavior
 for the remaining 
problems.

Wrong analysis!
The optimizers don't converge to the unique 
value. The above reasoning process is right and
 will actually lead Gemini to a correct answer. 
However, it gives the wrong answer simply 
based on the original one.
But this optimizer mistake is not a 
hallucination, it's a reasoning or mathematical 
error.

Give hints for Gemini to fix its problem.
But the formula's code seems to lead Gemini to 
produce bad formulas which can not shown 
correctly.(see the below result)


--- Page 8 ---
Still, Gemini is able to fix its 
problem based on my hint.
Have to provide it with the image.
But the form in this problem is expressed 
in a textual way, and Gemini reproduces it 
quite well.

Comprehensive reasoning process and correct 
answers in the right form.
