Kimi solved part a in 
one-shot, interpreting all 
parts of the problem 
correctly and taking the 
grad. relative to theta 
correctly to find 
minimizer.
Kimi seemed to 
misinterpret the penalty 
term early as infinity 
norm, without the 
square and routed to 
using alternate 
methods to solve the 
problem by adding a 
threshold for some 
values of dtheta_i
correctly found that each element of 
dtheta_i has opposite sign of 
corresponding element in g, and also 
equal magnitude across dtheta
still using threshold off of g_i 
values
after indicating the penalty term is 
squared, kimi was able to 
concretely arrive at the correct 
solution
Provided model with homework pdf 
and used chain of thought in 
prompt to allow Kimi to 
sequentially solve problem. 
Prepended with "you are expert" 
message. Have read it's goal is to
