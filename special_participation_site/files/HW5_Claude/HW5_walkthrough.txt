In this document, I will guide Claude AI to walk through the written problems for HW5, showing 
its misconceptions and hallucinations. 
 
Question 1: 
Part(a) 
 
I would say it does a really good job here. The arguments it made are sensible. 
 
Part(b): 
 
It gives the right solution with the correct procedure.

Part(c): 
 
It correctly understands the nature of transpose convolution output and generalizes the idea 
from the 1-dimensional example to the 2-dimensional case. However, it made a minor 
calculation error. The center entry of the square matrix should be -3 instead of 0.

Then I asked it to recalculate part c by telling it that there is a mistake. Unfortunately, it still gives 
the wrong solution. Obviously, once it makes a small mistake, it will remember it and get stuck 
on previous misconceptions even with explicit prompts telling it about the mistake. 
 
Question 2 
Part (a):  
Its response is very interesting. Though it demonstrates the right conceptual understanding 
about batch normalization and layer normalization, it fails to apply such understanding to 
recognize the right visual representation from figures. 
 
 
Part (b): 
It gets the right algebraic representation using chain rule. For the sanity check, it calculates the 
right solution for n = 1 case with the right reasoning. However, for the infinity case, it fails to 
recognize the most obvious reasoning that could be made to argue that the summation part will 
go to 0. Instead, it tries to make some more meaningless complicated arguments that interpret 
the summation part as expectation.

Question 3 
It correctly reasons about both part (a) and part (b).

Question 4 
Part (a): It almost arrives at a perfect solution except step 6. From step 1 to 5, it puts the right 
argument regarding algebraic expansions and matrix expectation calculations. At step 6, it omits 
the most obvious quadratic pattern and does something meaningless and more complicated.

Part (b): 
It makes a sensible argument about inference time scaling when dropouts are involved during 
training time. However, it fails to give a mathematical explanation about how the such scaling 
can be absorbed by w and tau. 
 
 
Part (c) 
It is doing the right reparameterization.

Part (d) 
It makes exactly the right argument about the implicit impacts of dropouts as a kind of 
normalization.  
 
 
Summarization for using Claude AI as a homework helper: 
I have to acknowledge that Claude AI is a very powerful tool that can help us walk through the 
homework. I rarely see any hallucinations or misconceptions. Most of the arguments it made are 
consistent with the right solution especially when the questions are fairly straightforward. 
However, when it is asked to derive something that requires many intermediate steps, it will 
sometimes fail to recognize the most obvious thing to do at some point. That is to say, for 
long-horizon tasks, it tends to make its solutions more complex even though such complex 
reasoning is not ideal.
