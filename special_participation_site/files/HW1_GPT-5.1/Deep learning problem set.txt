Decided to write in a slightly 
different form compared to the 
solution; the same answer as the 
solution is just multiplied by (-1) in 
numberator and denominator
Arrived at the correct answer, 
but decided to generalize this 
logic to any i, though it doesn’t 
add any additional information 
to us since we are just working 
with two singular values.

indeed the earlier analysis is the general case in SVD 
coordinates. Didn’t spell out the relation to change of 
bases as verbatim, though.
Carried out the same steps as the

deﬁned the same w’’
correct logic, with correct dimensions. 
Additionally speciﬁes that the 
diagonals in e are positive, 
presumably to make it clear that the 
Sigma_e part of the Sigma matrix is 
the only part with non-negative 
singular values. The LLM merely 
states the positivity fact without 
underlying reasoning (in ﬁrst pass)
This second vector is (V^T)*w’ split after n points, with the point of showcasing that only the points from w’’_{1:n} remain.
Uses min-norm justiﬁcation to skip a lot of 
intermediate steps, but it’s true and an elegant result.

I found this explanation quite 
intuitive to follow along, and it 
seemed to emphasize/show 
intermediate steps which was 
beneﬁcial for my learning.
Good use of markov inequality
Doesnt explicitly say that as t goes to inﬁnity, 
Lyapunov func goes to zero, converging 
exponentially. However, the logic is valid.

Did not include the eta term in the ﬁnal 
answer. However, I believe this LLM solution 
might be correct while the course solution is 
wrong; the equation we are trying to show 
(59) already includes the eta term, thus c1 
should not include it.

Did not break down into singular-value land; utilized the min singular value
not the max sing value. I believe there is nothing wrong with the ﬁnal answer

Corectly showed an upper bound of eta that exists, so we can always
just choose some number less than c1/c2 to ﬁnd an appropriate eta.
I was interested that the LLM used 
wording like “the notebook 
illustrates …” and from this 
response, it seems like it knows 
about the decay schedule 
(memory)..
but I was curious if it’s actually 
able to see the notebook, since all 
I uploaded
was the pdf of the homework. A 
follow up question I asked 
(included here instead as a 
footnote at the end of the trace):
My prompt: Are you able to see 
the notebook demo in question 
3k?
LLM response: Short answer: 
nope, I can’t actually see that 
speciﬁc notebook demo unless 
you paste it or upload it.
I don’t have access to your course 
materials / Colab / Jupyter 
environment. When I talked about 
“the notebook illustrates…” in 3k, I 
was describing what a typical 
ridge-regression demo would 
show given the theory, not literally 
reading your class’s notebook.
If you want me to reason with the 
actual demo, you can:
paste the relevant cells (code + 
plots description), or
export the notebook as a .ipynb or 
PDF and upload it.
Then I can walk through exactly 
what it’s doing and tie it back to 
the theory in 3(k).

I’m 
impressed 
that it can do 
problems 
involving 
stacking the 
coorinate 
pairs, and 
keep track of 
them 
correctly
Correctly identiﬁed the 
relationships between 
the discriminant and 
real/conjugate 
eigenvalues. Decided 
to deﬁne a variable “T” 
to help formulate the 
solution, leveraging the 
multiple uses of the 
value in T to declutter 
the solution. I thought 
this was a nice touch!

The restrictions it yielded are 
looser than they should be; 
there is a section in the middle 
of (2-beta-2(sqrt(1-beta))/
(2*beta(sigma_i^2) and (2-
beta+2*sqrt(1-beta))/
2(beta*sigma_i^2) where there 
are not two different real roots.

correct highest learning rate! 
the point of this question however is the 
takeaway that we have to choose eta
such that R_i’s eigenvalues
are the same real roots or complex roots.
However, from the LLM answer this is not 
immediately clear. Though it answered
the question correctly.

Again, upon further probing, the LLM admits that it cannot see the notebook demo in this 
question. However it still answers this question quite speciﬁcally, meaning it just guessed 
from the question setup what might be shown in the notebook. This isn’t reassuring, because
it’s preferable the LLM just admits when it doesn’t know something rather than potentially 
hallucinate.

Question 2c again. 
Prompt was: Can you go 
deeper on your 
reasoning for question 
2c? Can you show me 
how , given the i-th 
equation of equation 30 
(X~ * w~) = 0 is zero? 
The steps were a little 
unclear (to me at least)

LLM was unable to open jupyter notebooks linked in question 2k and 3h and 3i. It pretended
to know what was in them though, as shown in the ﬁrst pass.
