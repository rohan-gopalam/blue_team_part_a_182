I start with a simple prompt and the entire pdf for homework 4 
as a batch. I want Qwen to try to one shot all these problems 
ﬁrst, then I probe each mistake it makes problem by problem. 
NOTE: This is actually my third time trying this. Qwen 
struggled with certain problems like 2 with more complex 
prompting often regurgitating results continuously and giving 
very long chat logs.
Qwen one shots problem 1 no 
problem. Across all my attempts with 
this homework and Qwen, Qwen 
impressively never struggled this 
problem always giving total and 
asymyptotic runtime.

qwen gives total runtime and 
asymptotic runtime after dropping the 
scaling factors. Its nice to see both 
answers.

Qwen does fairly well for problem 2 but struggles on part e neglecting to account for the 
scaling factors. Still impressive though especially with its performance on parts f and g.
Qwen does not just state using xavier would not utilize the full dynamic range of fp8 but also 
gives mathematical reasoning without asking. Although it should specify what “n” is here 
especially in fan in and fan out terms.
Describes the goals of xavier initialization 
(why we care) without asking. I ﬁnd this 
very useful so I can keep track of the big 
ideas behind all the topics in DL

Problem 2e Qwen struggled with. In its ﬁrst pass it neglects to consider the 
scaling factor present due to the constraints in part (c). I later correct this but in all 
my experiments Qwen failed 2e.
Qwen does well for parts f and g but should specify what the 
d_out,n and d_in,n represent for clarity.
Qwen one shots parts a and b but incorrectly computes 
parts c and does not even provide answers for part d. This 
will be revisited later. Qwen also did not use a lot of 
intermediate reasoning regarding convolution 
formulas.This makes some of its responses hard to 
follow.

I ﬁnd it interesting when asking Qwen a graphical question, it does attempt to give 
a big picture graphical idea to visualize. I ﬁnd this very useful as a visual learner.
Qwen fails the basic 2D convolution problem 
in its ﬁrst pass. From inspecting its thinking 
logs I found it second guess itseﬂ after 
computing other entries as -40 almost 
paranoid it cannot be the answer.
Qwen does not even provide 
resulting matrices for part di and dii. 
This is strange as its simply a follow 
up to part c but its possible the 
simplicity in the probelm tricked it 
up.

As someone who found this problem very challenging, I 
would have liked it if Qwen provided more intermediate 
reasoning by default for this. Still it one shots the problem 
impressively.

Qwen one shots all of problem 7 but similar 
to before does not provide nearly enough 
reasoning by default. I ask it to give more 
detail later on to really stress test this 
problem and it performs well there.

account the scaling and spectral

Despite being given a second chance Qwen still 
does not consider the scaling factor sticking with 
its ﬁnal result instead. This to me seems to 
suggest a hallucination as I blatantly told it its 
incorrect yet it comes back with the same 
answer. To probe this failure more, I give Qwen 
the solution to see how we can arrive to the

Qwen now realizes its answer is 
incorrect but begins spiraling trying 
to ﬁx it and not hallucinate. This 
happened every time I attempted 
problem 2e with Qwen oftentimes 
to an extreme amount (3 retries in 
the same prompt).

Still is confused and lost 
Qwen eventually arrives to the right answer but its after multiple rethinks in a 
spiraling fashion. This feels more unique to Qwen then other LLMs in my 
experience. Despite this, after it accounts for the scaling factor it does reason 
its way to the correct solution.

After redoing all its computations, Qwen arrives to the right answer.

I found it interesting Qwen provided reasoning for the “all 
-40” answer. Its almost as its convincing itself its okay the 
answer is so simple and makes me call back to when it 
was concerned why every entry is -40.

Qwen one shot problem 7 originally, but when asking it to 
give more detail and less sparsity it excels in ﬂying colors 
giving easily understandable reasoning and solutions. Very 
impressive!
