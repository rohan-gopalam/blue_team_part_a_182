Kimi’s Performance on Homework 6
Interwoven Transcript and Evaluation
1
Problem 2: Graph Dynamics and GNN Concepts
1.1
(a) Output of the j-th Node at Layer k
Kimi’s Response:
We index layers k = 0,1,..., nodes i,j, channels c.
Initial input X^(0) = I.
Update: X^(k+1) = A X^(k).
Thus X^(k) = A^k.
The output of node j at layer k is row j of A^k.
Evaluation:
Fully correct.
1.2
(b) Counting Walks Using Ak
Kimi’s Response:
Prove (A^k)_{j,i} = L_k(i,j).
Base: A^0 = I.
Inductive step uses (A^(k+1))_{j,i} = sum_l A_{j,l} (A^k)_{l,i}
= sum_{l in V(j)} L_k(i,l) = L_{k+1}(i,j).
Evaluation:
Fully correct.
1.3
(c) Update Function
Kimi’s Response:
Matrix update: H^(k+1) = A H^(k).
Node update: h_j^(k+1) = sum_{i in V(j)} h_i^(k).
Evaluation:
Fully correct.

1.4
(d) Max Aggregation Interpretation
Kimi’s Response:
Using max means x_j^(k+1)[c] = max_{i in V(j)} x_i^(k)[c].
This acts like Boolean OR. Output is 1 iff a length-k path from c to j exists.
Evaluation:
Fully correct.
1.5
(e)(i) Representing Molecules as Graphs
Kimi’s Response (Excerpt):
Nodes contain detailed atomic features (electronegativity, hybridization,
ring membership, charges...). Edges contain bond order, conjugation,
Wiberg bond index, etc. Global contains molecule type and other global
properties.
Evaluation:
Correct idea but significantly over-engineered for homework expecta-
tions.
1.6
(e)(ii) Using Outputs to Predict First Broken Bond
Kimi’s Response:
Use per-edge logits: s_uv = MLP([h_u; h_v; h_uv; h_G]).
Softmax over all edges plus one "no-bond-break" class.
Evaluation:
Fully correct.
1.7
(e)(iii) Encoding Node Representations
Kimi’s Response (Excerpt):
Learned atomic embedding + physical features + positional encodings + MLP.
Evaluation:
Conceptually correct, but much more complex than expected. Home-
work expects to use learned element embedding.

Problem 3: Graph Neural Networks
2.1
(a) Validity of Update Rules
Kimi’s Response:
(i) Valid.
(ii) Invalid.
(iii) Valid.
Evaluation:
Fully correct.
2.2
(b) Training Loss
Kimi’s Response:
Loss = -(1/3) [log(b) + log(c) + log(1 - e)].
Evaluation:
Fully correct.
2.3
(c)(i) Design Patterns
Kimi’s Response:
Residual connection present. No batch normalization.
Evaluation:
Fully correct.
2.4
(c)(ii) Dimensions of W1
Kimi’s Response:
W1 is d × k.
Evaluation:
Fully correct.
2.5
(c)(iii) Expanded Update Rules for Nodes 2 and 3
Kimi’s Response (Incorrect):
Neighbors for node 2: {1,3}
Neighbors for node 3: {1,2,4}
(Uses these to expand update rules.)
Evaluation:
Incorrect. Kimi used the wrong neighbor sets.

2.6
(g) Missing Node Features
Kimi’s Response (Excerpt):
Uses mask vectors, learnable unknown token, auxiliary reconstruction loss,
variational treatment, etc.
Evaluation:
Conceptually fine, but far more complex than expected. Homework
expects: - Use a ”missing” token or mean fill; - Train with random masking augmenta-
tion.
2.7
(h) GraphNet Architecture
Kimi’s Response:
(i) Params unchanged; computation doubles in sparse case or ×4 in dense.
(ii) Weights live in update MLPs.
(iii) Directed edges handled by treating incoming/outgoing edges differently.
Evaluation:
Fully correct.
